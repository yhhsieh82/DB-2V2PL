# Assignment 5
In this assignment, you are asked to implement the two-version two-phase locking (2V2PL) for concurrency control in VanillaDB.

## Steps
To complete this assignment, you need to

1. Fork the Assignment 5 project
2. Trace the code in `as5-core`'s `org.vanilladb.core.storage.tx.concurrency`
3. Implement 2V2PL (its algorithm is described below)
4. Test (part of) correctness using provided test cases
5. Run experiments using provided benchmark project
6. Write an experiment analysis report
7. Push your repository to Gitlab and open a merge request

## 2V2PL
2V2PL is one simple variant of the two-phase locking (2PL). The main purpose of 2V2PL is to avoid **writes blocking reads**, thus improving read concurrency. To achieve this goal, 2V2PL introduces a new type of lock: shadow exclusive lock, which only blocks exclusive lock and itself, but not shared lock. In 2V2PL, a tx that attempts to modify a record follows the procedure below:

1. Acquire shadow exclusive lock on the record
2. Modify the record in **private workspace** (any modifications to the record are invisible to other txs before the tx commits)
3. Convert all shadow exclusive locks to exclusive locks before the tx commits
4. In-place update the modified records

Please note that in the second step, the modifications are invisible to other txs, but are visible to the tx making the modifications. That is, every read must be able to see its preceding writes **within a tx**.

The compatibility table of the 2V2PL is provided as follows:

### Compatibility table (with multi-granularity locking)

|          | S | X | IS | IX | SIX | Shadow X |
|----------|---|---|----|----|-----|----------|
| S        | O | X | O  | X  | X   | O        |
| X        | X | X | X  | X  | X   | X        |
| IS       | O | X | O  | O  | O   | O        |
| IX       | X | X | O  | O  | X   | X        |
| SIX      | X | X | O  | X  | X   | X        |
| Shadow X | O | X | O  | X  | X   | X        |

## Constrains
Here are some constraints you must follow during coding

- You should mainly modify the code in `org.vanilladb.core.storage`. However, you are **allowed** to modify other code if needed, but please explicitly specify the reason of such modification.
- Your 2V2PL implementation must at least pass the provided test cases.

If you follows the above rules and hand in your code along with your report in time, you will get at least 60% of scores. The rest of the score will be given by the correctness (in logic), performance and your analysis of experimental result.

Note that even if you passed all the test cases, it would not mean that there is no bug. We will check the logic of your modification during the demo.

We value the **correctness** of your implementation more than its **performance improvement**, that is, you may find your 2V2PL perform worse than the traditional 2PL, but still get a good score. However, you are not likely to get a good score if the implementation has obvious defects even though you achieve a significant performance improvement.

## Experiments



### Parameters

We provide a micro-benchmark to measure the performance of your 2V2PL implementation. The micro-benchmark is very simliar to the benchmarker in assignment 2.

There are some parameters in the benchmark you can adjust:

- NUM\_RTES (value > 1) - The number of clients
- RW\_TX\_RATE (1.0 >= value >= 0.0) - The probability of generating a write transaction
- TOTAL\_READ_COUNT (value >= 1) - The number of records read by a transaction
- LOCAL\_HOT_COUNT (TOTAL_READ_COUNT >= value >= 0) - The number of **hot** records read by a transaction
- WRITE\_RATIO\_IN\_RW\_TX (1.0 >= value >= 0.0) - The ratio of writes to the total reads of a transaction
- HOT\_CONFLICT\_RATE (0.1 >= value >= 0.001) - The probability of a hot record conclicting with each other

There is also a configuration in VanillaCore you can try:

- BUFFER\_POOL\_SIZE (value > 1) - The size of buffer pool

## The Report

- Briefly explain what you exactly do to implement 2V2PL
- Experiments
  - Your experiement enviornment including (a list of your hardware components, the operating system)
    - e.g. Intel Core i5-3470 CPU @ 3.2GHz, 16 GB RAM, 128 GB SSD, CentOS 7
  - The experiments showing the performance difference between using traditional 2PL and 2V2PL
  - The experiments showing the performance difference under different parameters
  - Give a reasonable analysis of your experimental result (both the expected and the unexpected can be mentioned)

	Note: There is no strict limitation to the length of your report. Generally, a 2~3 pages report with some figures and tables is fine. **Remember to include all the group members' student IDs in your report.**

## Submission

The procedure of submission is as following:

1. Fork our [Assignment 5](https://shwu10.cs.nthu.edu.tw/courses-databases-2018-spring/db18-assignment-5) on GitLab
2. Clone the repository you forked
3. Finish your work and write the report
4. Commit your work, push your work to GitLab.
  - Name your report as `[Team Member 1 ID]_[Team Member 2 ID]_assignment5_report`
    - E.g. `102062563_103062528_assignment5_report.pdf`
5. Open a merge request to the original repository.
  - Source branch: Your working branch.
  - Target branch: The branch with your team number. (e.g. `team-1`)
  - Title: `Team-X Submission` (e.g. `Team-1 Submission`).

**Important: We do not accept late submission.**

## No Plagiarism Will Be Tolerated

If we find you copy someoneâ€™s code, you will get 0 point for this assignment.


## Demo

Due to the complexity of this assignment, we hope you can come to explain your work face to face. We will announce a demo time registration table after submission. Don't forget to choose the demo time for your team.

## Hint

- Take a look at the class `LockTable`, and observe how we implement the compatibility table in the absence of shadow lock
- You may want to modify the class `Transaction` to create a per-tx private workspace
- Every update to a record will eventually reach the `setVal()` method of `RecordFile`, which might be a good timing to perform either a shadow write or an in-place write

## Deadline
Sumbit your work before **2018/05/29 (Tue.) 23:59:59**.
